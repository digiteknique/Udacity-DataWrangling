There were also differences in how directional information was stored. For example, N vs North. To fix these inconsistencies, I wrote code that split the street name into individual words and checked each one against my mapping to replace when needed. You will also note in the function that it handles 2 special cases. There were incomplete addresses and in one instance the zip code for the street name.
